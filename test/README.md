# Unit Tests for Node.js User Details API

This directory contains unit tests for the Node.js User Details API application.

## Test Files

1. `app.test.js` - Contains unit tests using a recreated app for testing
2. `app.module.test.js` - Contains unit tests using the modular app approach (requires `app.module.js`)

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you need to install the required dependencies first:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest supertest jest-mock-extended
```

Then you can run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

Or to run with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Structure

The tests are organized by API endpoints:

- GET /get-users
- POST /add-user
- PUT /update-user/:id
- DELETE /delete-user/:id

Each endpoint has tests for:
- Successful operations
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## Mocking

The tests use Jest's mocking capabilities to mock the MySQL database connection, allowing us to test the API without requiring an actual database connection.

## Improvements

Some potential improvements to the API that were identified during testing:

1. Add input validation for required fields
2. Return appropriate status codes for different scenarios (e.g., 404 for non-existent resources)
3. Add error handling middleware instead of throwing errors directly
4. Return more informative responses (e.g., include the ID of newly created users)
